# ASP.NET-Basic-Remote-Control-App-
A C# ASP.NET MVC framework bare-bones self-contained remote control app.

Control any executable process in your PC using your mobile device.

Just point the file path of the process you want control to a particular virtual device from the app and you should be able to start or stop it from a web browser.

A simple sample is included under Model folder to start off your process control.

This project is based on C# ASP.NET MVC.
